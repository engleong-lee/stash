# Screenshot Guide for Chrome Web Store

Chrome Web Store requires at least 1 screenshot (up to 5), size: 1280x800 or 640x400

## Required Screenshots

### 1. Main View (`screenshot_main.png`)
- Show the popup with the search bar, "Stash All Tabs" button, and a few saved sessions
- Have 2-3 sessions with different AI-generated names visible
- Make sure the extension looks polished

### 2. AI Naming in Action (`screenshot_ai_naming.png`)
- Open a new tab with an interesting page (e.g., programming tutorial)
- Click "Stash All Tabs"
- Capture the save dialog showing the AI-generated name with the 🦙 Ollama indicator
- Show the spinner or the "Suggested by Ollama" text

### 3. Tab Preview (`screenshot_preview.png`)
- Hover over a session to show the tab preview
- Click "+ more tabs" to show the expanded list
- Capture this expanded view

### 4. Settings (`screenshot_settings.png`)
- Open Settings
- Show the AI Features section with Ollama selected and "✓ Running" status

## Tips for Great Screenshots

1. **Use a clean browser** - Close unnecessary tabs
2. **Use meaningful session names** - "React Documentation Review", "Project Research", etc.
3. **Test in both light and dark mode** - Consider including a dark mode screenshot
4. **Make sure Ollama is running** - Show the "✓ Running" status
5. **Use a high-DPI display** if possible for crisp screenshots
